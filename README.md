## üìù Blogs  

### Blog 1: Optimizing Docker Images for Faster MERN Stack Deployments
This blog dives into systems for improving Docker pictures to smooth out the sending of MERN stack applications. By limiting picture measures and further developing form productivity, designers can accomplish quicker organizations and better asset usage.

Implementation Steps: 
- **Using Official Base Images**: Start with lightweight official Node.js images to reduce bloat.
- **Multi-Stage Builds**: Separate build and runtime stages to minimize the final image size.
- **Layer Caching**: Leverage Docker's layer caching to speed up subsequent builds.
- **Minimizing Dependencies**: Install only production dependencies to avoid unnecessary files.
- **Custom .dockerignore**: Exclude non-essential files like `.git` and `node_modules` to reduce context size.
- **Performance Testing**: Validate improvements using tools like docker stats to measure resource usage.

### Blog 2: Deploying an EKS Cluster on AWS using Terraform: A Step-by-Step Guide  
This guide explains how to use **Terraform** to automate the provisioning of an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster. It covers prerequisites like AWS CLI setup and Terraform installation, writing a Terraform configuration file for the EKS cluster, and initializing and applying the configuration. 

Key Highlights:  
- Configure Terraform files for the VPC and EKS cluster.
- Use terraform init, plan, and apply commands for deployment.
- Connect to the EKS cluster with kubectl.
- Deploy a sample Nginx application and clean up resources using terraform destroy.
